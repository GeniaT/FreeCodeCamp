Simon Game is a game where you have to play the same combination of colors than the computer. 

If you play under "Strict" mode, you return to level 1 if you miss a color. 
If you play without "Strict mode", you can miss and try again. 

On safari mobile, a bug has been detected: Safari mobile doesn't treat divs as clickable.
