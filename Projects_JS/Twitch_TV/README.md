Twitch_tv is made of a list of a view of my favorite streamers from https://www.twitch.tv/
Basically, I use Twitch API to get all the information on my page and am able to sort by connection the various streamers and click
on them to view them on the official Twitch site if I decide to. 

From what I lately noticed, the behavior when clicking on a streamer doesn't display well the destination Twitch site when you try to reach it via codepen.io. It appears to be a Twitch issue. On the other hand, when the code is ran locally, the behavior is correct. 

Check the app and its code over there: https://codepen.io/Genia/pen/JRQZMq
