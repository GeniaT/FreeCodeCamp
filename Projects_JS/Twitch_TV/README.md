Twitch_tv is made of a list of a view of my favorite streamers from https://www.twitch.tv/
Basically, I use Twitch API to get all the information on my page and am able to sort by connection the various streamers and click
on them to view them on the official Twitch site if I decide to. 

From what I lately noticed, the behavior when clicking on a streamer doesn't display well the destination site. The url
is correct though. Maybe a recent API issue...
