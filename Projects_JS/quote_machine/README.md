One of my first javaScript app using an API. I check there for a quote and then display it on the page. 
You have the possibility to temporaly save the quote into your TOP 3 and share the quote on tweeter via a Tweet button. 

Check the Quote app and its code over there: https://codepen.io/Genia/pen/NRpVBz
