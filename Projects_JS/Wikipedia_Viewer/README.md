Here I used the Wikipedia API to use its search feature and display it directly on my page.
We can use the search on the app page, select an article we are interested in and then be redirected on Wikipedia page that we decided to visit. 

The possibility to view a random article from Wikipedia is also a feature of the app. 

One of the few first apps I created in javaScript. 

Check the Wikipedia app and its code over there: https://codepen.io/Genia/pen/kkmEgP
