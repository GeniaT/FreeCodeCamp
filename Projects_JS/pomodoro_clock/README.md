"pomodoro" files are the final ones. "clock" files are only for unit test purpose. 

To make the app a bit more original, I drawed addionally to the simple timer a reversed clock. 

The arrows are moving according to the value of the timer and the user is free to choose any length of pomodoro session and break.
